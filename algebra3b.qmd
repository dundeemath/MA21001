# Vector spaces

## Motivation
You have used vectors in previous modules to do elementary geometry.
These vectors were introduced as lines connecting two points with a
direction: $${\vec a} = \overrightarrow{PQ},$$ where $P$ is the starting
point of the vector and $Q$ is the endpoint. The space of all these
vectors is called the Euclidean space. It is usually introduced as a
two- or three-dimensional space, but it is possible to generalise this
to more dimensions. The Euclidean space was introduced as a simple model
for the physical space around us. One can furthermore introduce
orthogonal coordinates for the points in this space, e.g.
$$P =  (P_x,P_y,P_z) = (3,2,1).$$ and this then allows us to define the
components of a vector:
$${\vec a} = \overrightarrow{PQ} =  \begin{pmatrix}    Q_x- P_x \\ Q_y- P_y \\ Q_z -P_z  \end{pmatrix} $$
The identification between points and vectors in an Euclidean space
becomes particularly simple if we can choose $P$ to be the origin of the
coordinate system, $P=(0,0,0)$,
$${\vec a} = \overrightarrow{OQ} =   \begin{pmatrix}    Q_x \\ Q_y \\ Q_z  \end{pmatrix} .$$
Note that while the coordinates of points are usually denoted by a row
of numbers (tuplet), the components of vectors are written as a column.
An alternative way to write a vector is to write it as a sum of
multiples of unit vectors,
$${\vec v} =   v_x {\bf e}_x + v_y {\bf e}_y + v_z {\bf e}_z  =  \begin{pmatrix}    v_x \\ v_y \\ v_z  \end{pmatrix}.$$
An addition as well as a scalar multiplication was defined for these
vectors. Later, the scalar product between two vectors and the
cross-product (vector product) were also defined.

The operations on vectors of this Euclidean space $E$, the addition and
scalar multiplication, had certain properties, for instance

 
  + $\vec{u} + \vec{v}  \in  E$, closure condition for addition 
  + $\vec{u}+\vec{v}  =  \vec{v}+\vec{u}$, the addition is commutative
  + $\lambda (\vec{u}+ \vec{v})  =  \lambda \vec{u} + \lambda \vec{v}$, distributive law 
  + $\ldots$ 

In the following, we will generalise this space and define an abstract
notion of a vector space, which has a much wider range of applications.
To understand the crucial properties of such a definition, consider two
examples.

::: {#exm-    }
The captain of a sailing boat can calculate the velocity
of his ship (speed and direction over ground) as the sum of two
velocities: the velocity of his boat relative to the water (speed
through water) and the velocity of the water (drift due to tides or
ocean currents). The sum of the two velocities is found in the same way
as above, as the addition of two vectors; however, the coordinate system
used is usually a polar one (the angle as determined by a compass and
speed in knots) rather than a Cartesian one (x, y-components). The
velocities obtained this way are part of a *velocity space*. The
elements of this space, the velocities, follow the same rules of
addition and scalar multiplication as the vectors in our Euclidean
space. Remark: In this example, the velocity space is a tangent space to
a manifold (the surface of the ocean), a concept explained in more
detail in Differential Geometry.
:::

::: {#exm-    }
The set of all polynomials with degree $\leq n$ is
denoted by $\mathcal{P}_{n}$. We can add polynomials in
$\mathcal{P}_{n}$ to obtain a polynomial in $\mathcal{P}_{n}$ again.
Polynomials $p(x)= a_{0} + a_{1}x + ...+a_{n} x^{n}$ and
$q(x)= b_{0} + b_{1}x + ...+b_{n} x^{n}$$\in \mathcal{P}_{n}$ add up to
$$p(x)+q(x)  =  (a_{0}+ b_{0}) + (a_{1} + b_{1}) x + ...+(a_{n}+ b_{n}) x^{n}   \in \mathcal{P}_{n} .$$
Similarly, we can multiply polynomials by a scalar $$\lambda p(x)  =   \lambda a_{0} +  \lambda a_{1}x + ...+ \lambda a_{n} x^{n}  \in \mathcal{P}_{n}$$ Note that we can identify a
polynomial of degree $\leq n$ with the vector of coefficients
$$p(x) \sim  \scriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}    a_{0} \\ a_{1} \\ \vdots \\ a_{n}   \end{pmatrix} \textstyle.$$ 
:::

The two examples above illustrate that numerous diverse examples exist
where we find a structure similar to the Euclidean space. The elements
in these spaces often don't look like "vectors\"; they can be
polynomials, velocities, matrices, etc.~, but addition and scalar
multiplication work in the same way, so they follow the same rules as
vectors. This is the motivation to define an abstract notion of a vector
space and define it based on how its elements behave under addition and
scalar multiplication, rather than what they represent.

## Definition of a Vector Space

::: {.Definition #vksoverr}
## Vector Space over R
A vector space over $\mathbb{R}$ is a set $V$, the
elements of which are called vectors $\vec{v} \in V$ along with two
operations, an addition $\vec{v} + \vec{w}$ and a scalar multiplication
$a \vec{v}$, $a \in \mathbb{R}$, subject to the following axioms for all $\vec{u},\vec{v}, \vec{w}\in V$
and $a,b\in \mathbb{R}$ : 
 $$\vec{u} + \vec{v} \in  V$$ {#eq-cond0} 
 $$a \vec{u}  \in  V$$  {#eq-cond1} 
 $$\vec{u}+\vec{v} = \vec{v}+\vec{u}$$ {#eq-cond2} 
 $$(\vec{u}+\vec{v})+\vec{w}  = \vec{u}+(\vec{v}+\vec{w})$$ {#eq-cond3} 
 $$\text{there exists a vector } {\vec 0}  \in V \text{such that } \vec{u}+\vec{0} = \vec{0}+\vec{u}=\vec{u}$${#eq-cond4}
 $$ \text{given } \vec{v} \text{ there exists a vector } -\vec{v}  \in V  \text{ such that }\vec{v}+ (-\vec{v})  = \vec{0}$$ {#eq-cond5} 
 $$1 \vec{u}  = \vec{u}$$  {#eq-cond6} 
 $$a (\vec{u}+ \vec{v})  = a\vec{u} +a \vec{v}$$ {#eq-cond7}
 $$(a+b) \vec{u} = a\vec{u} +b \vec{u}$$  {#eq-cond8} 
 $$a (b \vec{u}) =(a b) \vec{u}$$ {#eq-cond9} 
:::

Axiom [-@eq-cond0] and [-@eq-cond1] ensure that both operations do not lead to elements
not in $V$,  [-@eq-cond2] to [-@eq-cond5] ensure that the addition is commutative and associative and that there is a neutral element $\vec{0}$ and an inverse
element with respect to the addition.
Axiom [-@eq-cond6] states that the neutral element of the multiplication in $\mathbb{R}$ is also
the neutral element for the scalar multiplication, while the remaining
conditions are distributive laws.


::: {.callout-note} 
## Remark on Notation
Alternative notations for vectors encountered in the
literature are bold face symbols ${\bf v}$ or $\bar v$ (not to be
confused with complex conjugation) or $\underline v$. The zero vector
$\vec{0}$ is often written just as $0$. Note that there are two kinds of
additions in this definition, both denoted by the same symbol $+$. The
addition of two real numbers ($a+b$) and the addition of two vectors
$\vec{v}+\vec{w}$. Also, for the multiplication, we have
$ab \in \mathbb{R}$ as well as $a \vec{v} \in V$. No symbol is used for
multiplication, since the dot as well as the cross will be later used to
define two different types of multiplication between two vectors.

If we want to avoid writing a vector as a column, as this always takes up a lot of space, we can use the transpose (denoted by a superscript T):
$$ (1,2)^T = \begin{pmatrix}  1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}. $$
:::

::: {#exm-vktspace1}
The set
$\mathbb{R}^2 = \{(x_{1},x_{2})^T \vert x_{1} \in \mathbb{R}, x_{2} \in \mathbb{R}\}$
is a vector space, the elements of which are written as columns
$\vec{x}=\scriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   x_{1}\\x_{2}  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle$,
if addition and multiplication are defined as
$$ \begin{pmatrix}   x_1 \\ x_2  \end{pmatrix} 
  +
   \begin{pmatrix}   y_1 \\ y_2  \end{pmatrix} 
  =
   \begin{pmatrix}   x_1+y_1 \\ x_2+y_2  \end{pmatrix} ;
  \qquad
  a 
   \begin{pmatrix}   x_1 \\ x_2  \end{pmatrix} 
  =
   \begin{pmatrix}   a x_1 \\  a x_2  \end{pmatrix}  \ .$$
We have to check that all the axioms
[-@eq-cond0] to [-@eq-cond9] are
satisfied. 


 - axioms [-@eq-cond0] and [-@eq-cond1] are satisfied because the elements are again element in $V$.
  - axioms [-@eq-cond2] to [-@eq-cond3] are satisfied because the addition of real numbers in each entry of the vector is associative and commutative,
  - [-@eq-cond4] and [-@eq-cond5] are correct if we use the following zero vector and negative element:
  $$\vec{0}=\scriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   0\\0  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle \qquad   -\vec{x} = \scriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   -x_{1}\\-x_{2}  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle \ .$$
  - axiom [-@eq-cond6] is obvious from the definition of the scalar multiplication, 
  - axiom [-@eq-cond7]
  $$(r+s) \begin{pmatrix}   v_1 \\ v_2  \end{pmatrix} 
  =\begin{pmatrix}   (r+s)v_1 \\ (r+s)v_2  \end{pmatrix} 
  = \begin{pmatrix}   rv_1+sv_1 \\ rv_2+sv_2  \end{pmatrix} 
  =r \begin{pmatrix}   v_1 \\ v_2  \end{pmatrix} +s \begin{pmatrix}   v_1 \\ v_2  \end{pmatrix}; $$ 
  - axiom [-@eq-cond8]
  $$r \left( \begin{pmatrix}   v_1 \\ v_2  \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix}   w_1 \\ w_2  \end{pmatrix} \right)
  =\begin{pmatrix}   r(v_1+w_1) \\ r(v_2+w_2)  \end{pmatrix} 
  =\begin{pmatrix}   rv_1+rw_1 \\ rv_2+rw_2  \end{pmatrix} 
  =r \begin{pmatrix}   v_1 \\ v_2  \end{pmatrix} +r \begin{pmatrix}   w_1 \\ w_2  \end{pmatrix}; $$ 
  - axiom [-@eq-cond9]
  $$(rs) \begin{pmatrix}   v_1 \\ v_2  \end{pmatrix} 
  = \begin{pmatrix}   (rs)v_1 \\ (rs)v_2  \end{pmatrix} 
  =\begin{pmatrix}   r(sv_1) \\ r(sv_2)  \end{pmatrix} 
  =r \left(s \begin{pmatrix}   v_1 \\ v_2  \end{pmatrix} \right).$$

is **not** a vector space. The first two axioms (closure conditions) are
not satisfied. For example

$$a   \begin{pmatrix}   x_1 \\ x_2  \end{pmatrix}  =   \begin{pmatrix}   a x_1 \\  a x_2  \end{pmatrix}  \ ,$$

is **not** a vector space. Axioms 8 and 9 are not satisfied.
:::

::: {#exm-vktspace4}
What we have shown for a vector space consisting of two
vectors with two real components can be easily extended to n components.
The vector space
$$I\!\!R^{n} = \left\{ \left. \scriptscriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   v_{1}\\ v_{2} \\ \vdots \\ v_{n}  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle \right| v_{i} \in \mathbb{R}, i=1,2, .. ,n \right\}$$
together with the operation of addition
$$\scriptscriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   v_{1}\\ v_{2} \\ \vdots \\ v_{n}  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle +  \scriptscriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   w_{1}\\ w_{2} \\ \vdots \\ w_{n}  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle =  \scriptscriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   v_{1}+w_{1}\\ v_{2} +w_{2}\\ \vdots \\ v_{n}+w_{n}  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle , $$
and the scalar multiplication $$ \alpha \scriptscriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   v_{1}\\ v_{2} \\ \vdots \\ v_{n}  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle =  \scriptscriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}    \alpha v_{1}\\  \alpha v_{2} \\ \vdots \\  \alpha v_{n}  \end{pmatrix}, \textstyle \quad \alpha \in \mathbb{R},$$ is called the vector space $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.

Although we haven't defined yet what a basis is, we mention here for
future reference that the vectors,
$$\vec{e}_{1} =  \scriptscriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   1\\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0   \end{pmatrix} \textstyle, \quad  \vec{e}_{2} =  \scriptscriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   0\\ 1 \\ 0 \\ \vdots  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle, ...    ,\vec{e}_{n} =  \scriptscriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   0\\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 1   \end{pmatrix} \textstyle$$
form a basis of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, the so called the standard basis. That
is, every vector in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ can be expressed as a linear
combination of the basis vectors,
$$\vec{x} = x_{1} \vec{e}_{1} + x_{2} \vec{e}_{2} + ... + x_{n} \vec{e}_{n} ,$$
Or, in other words, the vector space is spanned by the basis vectors.
:::

::: {#exm-vktspace5}
The set of all $m\times n$ matrices where the entries are
real numbers forms a vector space. We denote this space by
$M^{(m \times n)}$. Addition and scalar multiplication are the usual
addition and scalar multiplication of matrices. A basis of the space
consists of the matrices ${\rm E}^{(i,j)}$ which have a 1 at entry (i,j)
and zeros everywhere else. The space is of dimension $m \times n$.

::: {#exm-vktspace7}
The solutions of a homogeneous linear differential
equation of order two, e.g.
$$\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}y(t)}{\mathrm{d}t^{2}}+y(t)=0.\qquad$$ form a vector space. The general solution is 
$$ y(t) = A \sin(t) + B \cos(t). $$ Addition and scalar multiplication
in this vector space are the usual addition and scalar multiplication of
functions. The space is spanned by two linearly independent solutions, $\sin(t)$ and $\cos(t)$.
This is an example of a so-called *function space*. The same holds for a homogenous linear ODE of n-th order. In this case there are $n$ linearly independent solutions.

The set $\mathcal{F}$ of all infinitely differentiable
functions, $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, i.e., those that have
derivatives of all orders. Note that (among others) the following
functions belong to $\mathcal{F}$: $$e^{nx},\,\cos \left( 2\pi nx\right)
,\,\,x^{n}\quad \,(\text{for all }n=0,1,2,...).$$ $\mathcal{F}$ is an
example of an infinite-dimensional space because it contains an
unlimited number of linearly independent elements.
:::

The definition of a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$ can be extended to a
vector space over a more general set of numbers, a field K. To
understand what a 'field' is, we need to take a short detour into number
systems.


::: {.Definition #vksoverk}
## Vector Space over K
A vector space over a field $K$ is a set $V$, the
elements of which are called vectors $\vec{v} \in V$ along with two
operations, an addition $\vec{v} + \vec{w}$ and a scalar multiplication
$a \vec{v}$, $a \in K$, subject to the same 10 axioms
@eq-cond0 to @eq-cond9 as before only that now $a,b\in K$.
:::

::: {#exm-vktspace9}
The set \ref{vksoverk} $\mathbb{C}^{n} =\{ (c_{1},...,c_{n})^{T}| c_{1},..,c_{n}\in \mathbb{C}\}$
is a vector space over $\mathbb{C}$. Addition and scalar multiplication
are the usual addition and scalar multiplication of complex numbers. A
basis for this space is given by the n vectors $e_{1}=(1,0,...,0)$,\...,
$e_{n}=(0,...,0,1)$. The space has $n$ dimensions. Note that we can
identify $\mathbb{C}$ with $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ due to $z= a + b i$ with
$a,b \in \mathbb{R}$. Hence $\mathbb{C}^{n}  \sim \mathbb{R}^{2n}$ is
also a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$, but in this case it is
2n-dimensional with two basis vectors for the real and imaginary part of
each complex dimension.
:::

## Linear independence

In the same way as a coordinate system is introduced on a plane to
allocate a unique pair of coordinates to any point in the plane, we
would like to have a coordinate system for a vector space, which
uniquely assigns to any vector of this space a coordinate tuple (set).
To generate such a coordinate system, we need a set of 'basis' vectors
which are, in a sense, independent. Consider the following example in
the x-y plane.

Given the two unit vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$,
$$\vec{e}_1 = \scriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   1 \\ 0  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle, \ \vec{e}_2= \scriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   0 \\ 1  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle$$
Any point in the plane, that is, any vector in $\mathbb{R}^2$, can be
represented by a linear combination
$$\vec{v } = v_1  \vec{e}_1  + v_2  \vec{e}_2,  v_1,v_2 \in \mathbb{R}$$
where $(v_1,v_2)$ play the role of coordinates. These coordinates are
unique; that is, there are no two different vectors with the same
coordinate pair, nor are two different coordinate pairs assigned to the
same vector.

The same is true if we replace our basis vectors by (check!)
$$\vec{e}_1 = \scriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   1 \\ 0  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle, \ \vec{e}_2= \scriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   1 \\ 1  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle .$$

However, if we use a triplet of vectors:
$$\vec{e}_1 = \scriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   1 \\ 0  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle, \ \vec{e}_2= \scriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   0 \\ 1  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle,  \ \vec{e}_3= \scriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   1 \\ 1  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle ,$$
$$\vec{v } = v_1  \vec{e}_1  + v_2  \vec{e}_2 + v_3  \vec{e}_3 ,  v_1,v_2,v_3 \in \mathbb{R}$$

Then there are vectors with non-unique coordinates:
$$\vec{v}   = 2  \vec{e}_1 + 3  \vec{e}_2 -1 \vec{e}_3  =   1  \vec{e}_1 + 2  \vec{e}_2 + 0 \vec{e}_3$$

More generally, if such a non-unique case occurs, one can write
$$\begin{aligned}
 {\bf v} & =   v_1  \vec{e}_1 +  v_2 \vec{e}_2 + v_3 \vec{e}_3 \\
  {\bf v} & =   v_1'  \vec{e}_1 + v_2'  \vec{e}_2 + v_3' \vec{e}_3 \\
  \Rightarrow \vec{0} & =   (v_1-v_1')  \vec{e}_1 + (v_2-v_2')  \vec{e}_2 + (v_3-v_3') \vec{e}_3, \\
   \Rightarrow   \vec{0} & =   a_1  \vec{e}_1 + a_2  \vec{e}_2 + a_3 \vec{e}_3, \quad (a_1,a_2,a_3) \neq (0,0,0) 
  \end{aligned}$$ 
where at least one of the three brackets is non-zero
since we assumed that $(v_1,v_2,v_3) \neq (v_1',v_2',v_3')$. This is
called a non-trivial linear combination.

::: {.Definition}
##  Linear Combination
An expression of the form $a_{1}{\vec v}
_{1}+a_{2}{\vec v}_{2}+\cdots +a_{n}{\vec v}_{n}$ is known as a *linear
combination of the $n$ vectors ${\vec v}
_{1},{\vec v}_{2},\cdots ,{\vec v}_{n}$. The numbers
$a_{1}, a_{2},..., a_{n}$ are known as the coefficients of the linear
combination.*
:::

::: {.Definition}
## Linear Independence
A set of vectors $\vec{v_{1}}, \vec{v_{2}},..., \vec{v_{n}}$ is called *linearly
independent* if none of its elements is a linear combination of the
others. That is the equation
$$a_{1}\vec{v_{1}} + a_{2} \vec{v_{2}}+  ... + a_{n}\vec{v_{n}} = 0$$
has no solution ($a_{1},a_{2},..,a_{n})$ other than the trivial solution
$(0,0,...,0)$. Otherwise, the set is called *linearly dependent*.
:::

I.e., a set of vectors is linearly dependent if we can find a
non-trivial linear combination that yields the zero vector. Note that a
simple relation between just two of the vectors, e.g.
$\mathbf{v}_{1}=3\mathbf{v}_{2},$ is enough to make the complete set
$\mathit{
\{}\mathbf{v}_{1},\mathbf{v}_{2},...,\mathbf{v}_{n}\mathit{\}}$ linearly
dependent.

::: {#exm-li1}
Are the vectors $(1,-1,0)^{T},(2,1,1)^{T}$ and
$(-1,2,1)^{T}$ linearly independent?

We solve 
$$a_{1} \begin{pmatrix}   
1 \\ 
-1 \\ 
0  \end{pmatrix} +a_{2}  \begin{pmatrix}   
2 \\ 
1 \\ 
1  \end{pmatrix} +a_{3}  \begin{pmatrix}   
-1 \\ 
2 \\ 
1  \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}   
0 \\ 
0 \\ 
0  \end{pmatrix}.$$
 for $(a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3})$. We find that
$a_{1}=a_{2}=a_{3}=0$; so the 3 given vectors are linearly independent.
If we replace the first entry in the first vector by 3, the set becomes
linearly dependent. A solution is $a_1=1$, $a_2=-1$, $a_3=1$.
:::

::: {#exm-    }
Are the vectors $(1,0,0)^{T}$, $(1,1,0)^{T}$ and
$(1,0,1)^{T}$ linearly independent?

$$a_{1} \scriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   1 \\ 0 \\ 0  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle + a_{2} \scriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   1 \\ 1 \\ 0  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle + a_{3} \scriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   1 \\ 0 \\ 1  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle = \scriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   0\\0\\0  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle,$$
for $(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3})$. The third component of this equation implies
$a_{3}=0$. From the second and first component follow $a_{2}=0$ and
$a_{1} =0$. Hence, the vectors are linearly independent.

On the other hand, the vectors
$$\scriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   1 \\ 0 \\ 0  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle, \quad \scriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   1 \\ 1 \\ 0  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle,  \quad \scriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   0 \\ 1 \\ 0  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle,$$
are linearly dependent, since the third component reads $a_{3} 0 = 0$
which is satisfied for any $a_{3}=\lambda$. The second component requires $a_{2} = - a_{3}$ and the first
$a_{1} = a_{3}$. So there are non-trivial solutions $(\lambda , -\lambda , \lambda )$, e.g. $(1,-1,1)$.

vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is the whole of $\mathbb{R}^{3}$.

::: {#exm-    }
The set $\{(1,0)^{T},(0,1)^{T}\}$ spans
$\mathbb{R}^{2}$. 
$$\begin{aligned}
{\rm span}\left(\scriptscriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   1\\0  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle,\scriptscriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   0\\1  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle\right) & = \left\{ \left. \vec{v} = a_1 \scriptscriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   1\\0  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle + a_2 \scriptscriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   0\\1  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle\right| a_1,a_2 \in \mathbb{R} \right\} \\

can be expressed as a linear combination of $(1,0)^{T}$ and $(0,1)^{T}$.

If we add another vector, e.g.
$${\rm span}\left(\scriptscriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   1\\0  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle,\scriptscriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   0\\1  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle, \scriptscriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   1\\1  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle \right) =\mathbb{R}^{2},$$
then the space may or may not become any bigger. In this case, the space
remains the same since the third vector is a linear combination of the
first two vectors, that is, the set is linearly dependent. The smallest
linearly independent set which spans a given vector space is called a
basis.

::: {.Definition}
## Basis
A basis of a vector space is a linearly
independent set of vectors which span the vector space.
:::

::: {#exm-    }
The set of vectors
$\left\{(1,0,0)^{T}, (0,1,0)^{T}, (0,0,1)^{T}\right\}$ forms a basis of
$\mathbb{R}^{3}$ (more generally $K^{3}$ for a field $K$), the set of
vectors $\left\{(1,0,0,0)^{T}, (0,1,0,0)^{T},\right\}$\
$\left (0,0,1,0)^{T},(0,0,0,1)^{T}\right\}$ forms a basis of
$\mathbb{R}^{4}$ (more generally $K^{4}$) and so on. This is called the
**standard basis** of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ ($K^{n}$ in more general sense)
for $n\in\mathbb{N}$.
:::

::: {#exm-    }
The vectors
$$\vec{f}_{1} =  \scriptscriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   0\\ 1 \\ 1   \end{pmatrix} \textstyle, \quad \vec{f}_{2} =  \scriptscriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   0\\ 1 \\ 0   \end{pmatrix} \textstyle, \quad \vec{f}_{3} =  \scriptscriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   0\\ 0 \\ 1  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle,$$
do not form a basis for $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ since they do not span the
whole $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. The vector $\vec{e}_{1}$, for instance, has no
representation in this set.
:::

::: {#exm-    }
The vectors
$$\vec{f}_{1} =  \scriptscriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   1\\ 0 \\ 0   \end{pmatrix} \textstyle, \quad \vec{f}_{2} =  \scriptscriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   0\\ 1 \\ 0   \end{pmatrix} \textstyle, \quad \vec{f}_{3} =  \scriptscriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   0\\ 0 \\ 1  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle, \quad  \vec{f}_{4} =  \scriptscriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   1\\ 1 \\ 1   \end{pmatrix} \textstyle ,$$
are also not a basis. Although they span the whole $\mathbb{R}^{3}$,
they are not linearly independent.
:::

::: {#exm-    }
Consider the set of all $n\times n$ matrices with real
entries $\mathbb{R}^{(n\times n)}$. Let $E_{ij}$ be the $n\times n$
matrix with a '1' in position $(i,j)$ and '0' elsewhere. Then the
collection of all such matrices (for all $i,j=1,2,\ldots,n$) is a basis
for $\mathbb{R}^{(n\times n)}$.

Consider the case $n=2$, then the basis matrices are
$$\left(\begin{array}{cc}
 a & b\\
 c & d
 \end{array}\right)=aE_{11}+bE_{12}+cE_{21}+dE_{22},\quad\textrm{(spanning)}.$$
Also, we can show that the four $E$ matrices are linearly independent.
$$\alpha _{1}E_{11}+\alpha _{2}E_{12}+\alpha _{3}E_{21}+\alpha _{4}E_{22}=\mathbf{0}$$ means that 
$$\left(\begin{array}{cc}
 \alpha _{1} & \alpha _{2}\\
 \alpha _{3} & \alpha _{4}
 \end{array}\right) = \left(\begin{array}{cc}
 0 & 0\\
 0 & 0
 \end{array}\right),\quad\textrm{i.e.   }\alpha _{1}=\alpha _{2}=\alpha _{3}=\alpha _{4}=0.$$ Since the four matrices span the space and are linearly
independent, they form a basis for $\mathbb{R}^{(n\times n)}$.
:::

::: {.Theorem}
## Uniqueness w.r.t. a basis
Let $\left\{ {\vec v}_{1},{\vec v}_{2},\dots ,{\vec v}
_{n}\right\}$ be a basis for a vector space $V.$ Each vector from $V$
can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of these vectors.
:::

::: {.Proof}
If there were two different representations of a vector
${\vec v}$ with respect to this basis: Eg.
${\vec v} =a_{1}{\vec v}_{1} + \dots + a_{n }{\vec v}_{n}$ and
${\vec v} =b_{1}  {\vec v}_{1} + \dots + b_{n }{\vec v}_{n}$, then the
difference
${\bf 0} =(a_{1} - b_{1}){\vec v}_{1} + \dots + (a_{n }-b_{n}){\vec v}_{n}$
would be a non-trivial linear combination representing the zero vector,
which is impossible since the vectors ${\vec v}_{1},\dots ,{\vec v}_{n}$
were linearly independent. ◻
:::

::: {#exm-    }
In $\mathbb{R}^{3},$
$$\begin{pmatrix}   2 \\ 
-3 \\ 
4  \end{pmatrix} =2 \begin{pmatrix}   
1 \\ 
0 \\ 
0  \end{pmatrix} -3 \begin{pmatrix}   
0 \\ 
1 \\ 
0  \end{pmatrix} +4 \begin{pmatrix}   
0 \\ 
0 \\ 
1  \end{pmatrix} =2{\vec e}_{1}-3{\vec e}_{2}+4{\vec e}_{3}.$$

So, any linear combination of the vectors ${\vec e}_{1},
{\vec e}_{2},{\vec e}_{3}$ is a vector in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and any
vector in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ can be written as a linear combination of
${\vec e}_{1},{\vec e}
_{2},{\vec e}_{3}$ and the expression is unique.
:::

::: {#exm-    }
A different basis, other than the standard
basis, for the $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is, for instance
$$\vec{f}_{1} =  \scriptscriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   1\\ 1 \\ 0   \end{pmatrix} \textstyle, \quad \vec{f}_{2} =  \scriptscriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   0\\ 1 \\ 0   \end{pmatrix} \textstyle, \quad \vec{f}_{3} =  \scriptscriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   0\\ 0 \\ 1  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle,$$
We can check that we still can express any vector with respect to
(w.r.t.) this basis. We express the arbitrary vector $\vec{r}$ first
w.r.t. the standard basis and show that we can translate this into a
representation w.r.t. the new basis: 
$$\begin{aligned}
 \vec{r} & = r_{1} \vec{e}_{1} + r_{2} \vec{e}_{2} +r_{3} \vec{e}_{3}  \\
  & = r_{1} (\vec{e}_{1} + \vec{e}_{2})  + (r_{2}-r_{1}) \vec{e}_{2} +r_{3} \vec{e}_{3}  \\
  & = r_{1} \vec{f}_{1} + (r_{2}-r_{1}) \vec{f}_{2} +r_{3} \vec{f}_{3}  .
\end{aligned}$$
 And this expression is unique. In addition, the
definition of a basis requires that the new basis vectors are linearly
independent, which they are; otherwise, they could not span the whole
three-dimensional space.
:::

We note that there are different bases, but they all have the same
number of elements.

::: {.Theorem}
## Number of elements of a basis
Every basis of a vector space contains the same number
of vectors, this number being the largest set of linearly independent
vectors in the set.
:::

::: {.Proof}
Suppose that a vector space $V$ has two bases, one of which is
$\left\{ {\vec w}_{1},...,{\vec w}_{p}\right\}$ that contains $p$
vectors and the other $\left\{ {\vec z}_{1},...,{\vec z}_{q}\right\}$
that contains $q$ vectors. We can assume that $p>q.$ We shall show that
the vectors $\left\{ {\vec w}_{1},...,{\vec w}_{p}\right\}$ are linearly dependent,
contradicting the fact that they form a basis.

To begin, since
$V={\rm span}\left( {\vec z}_{1},...,{\vec z}_{q}\right)$ and each of
the ${\vec w}$'s lies in $V,$ they must be linear combinations of the
${\vec z}$'s. i.e., 
$$\begin{aligned}
{\vec w}_{1} &=c_{11}{\vec z}_{1}+c_{21}{\vec z}_{2}+\cdots +c_{q1}
{\vec z}_{q} \\
&\vdots \\
{\vec w}_{p} &=c_{1p}{\vec z}_{1}+c_{2p}{\vec z}_{2}+\cdots +c_{qp}
{\vec z}_{q}.
\end{aligned}$$ Now consider a linear combination of the ${\vec w}$'s:
$$\begin{aligned}
\sum_{j=1}^{p}a_{j}{\vec w}_{j}  = & a_{1}{\vec w}_{1}+\cdots +a_{p}
{\vec w}_{p} \\
= & a_{1}\left( c_{11}{\vec z}_{1}+c_{21}{\vec z}_{2}+\cdots +c_{q1}
{\vec z}_{q}\right) \\
&+ a_{2} \left( c_{12}{\vec z}_{1}+c_{22}{\vec z}_{2}+\cdots +c_{q2}
{\vec z}_{q}\right) \\
& \vdots \\
& + a_{p}\left( c_{1p}{\vec z}_{1}+c_{2p}{\vec z}_{2}+\cdots +c_{qp}
{\vec z}_{q}\right) \\
= & 
\left( c_{11}a_{1}+\cdots +c_{1p}a_{p}\right) {\vec z}_{1}+\cdots
+\left( c_{q1}a_{1}+\cdots +c_{qp}a_{p}\right) {\vec z}_{q}.
\end{aligned}$$ Can we choose the $a$'s so that the right-hand side is
zero? Since the ${\vec z}$'s are l.i., this will require that each of
the coefficients be zero: 
$$\begin{aligned}
c_{11}a_{1}+\cdots +c_{1p}a_{p} &=0 \\
&\vdots \\
c_{q1}a_{1}+\cdots +c_{qp}a_{p} &=0
\end{aligned}$$ but this is a system of $q$ equations in $p$ unknowns
with $p>q.$ Such a system always has non-zero solutions. Hence, there
will be a choice if the coefficients $a_{1},\ldots ,a_{p}$ (not all of
which are zero) so that $a_{1}
{\vec w}_{1}+\cdots +a_{p}{\vec w}_{p}=0.$ But this means that the
${\vec w}$'s are l.d.. We have a contradiction, since we assumed the
${\vec w}$'s form a basis. A similar argument can be applied if we
assume that $q>p.$ Thus, a contradiction can be avoided only when
$p=q.$ ◻

::: {.Definition}
## Dimension
The number of elements of a basis is
called the dimension of the space.
:::

::: {#exm-    }
$\mathbb{R}^{n}$ has dimension $n$.
:::

::: {#exm-    }
The space of polynomials of degree $\leq n$ has basis
$\{1, x, x^{2},\ldots,x^{n}\}$, so its dimension is $n+1$ (not $n$).
:::

::: {.callout-note} 
## Remark on dimension 
Note that the dimension of $V$ depends on the field $K$. Thus the
complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$ can be considered as a space of dimension $1$ over $\mathbb{C}$, or as a space of dimension $2$ over $\mathbb{R}$, where $\{1, i\}$ is a basis for $\mathbb{C}$ over $\mathbb{R}$.
:::

::: {.Theorem}
## Smaller spanning set
Any linearly dependent vectors of a spanning set can be omitted without making the span smaller. 
$${\rm span}({\vec v}_{1},{\vec v}_{2},...,{\vec v}_{n}) = {\rm span}( \text{largest  l.i. subset of }  {\vec v}_{1},{\vec v}_{2},...,{\vec v}_{n})$$
:::

::: {.Proof}
 Without loss of generality (w.l.o.g.) we can assume that
$\{{\vec v}_{1},{\vec v}_{2},...,{\vec v}_{r} \}$ is the largest
linearly independent subset ($r\le n$). Then any remaining vectors
${\vec v}_{r+1}, ... , {\vec v}_{n}$ can be expressed as a linear
combination of $\{{\vec v}_{1},{\vec v}_{2},...,{\vec v}_{r} \}$ hence
${\rm span}({\vec v}_{1},{\vec v}_{2},...,{\vec v}_{r}) = {\rm span}({\vec v}_{1},{\vec v}_{2},...,{\vec v}_{n})$ ◻
:::

::: {.Corollary #nvectorsspanrn}
$n$ linearly independent vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ span $\mathbb{R}^n$.  Vice versa a set of $n+1$ vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ must be
linearly dependent.
:::

::: {.Proof}
We know that the standard basis of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ consists of
$n$ elements, hence the dimension is $n$. Suppose the $n$ vectors would not span $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Then we could add vectors such that the new set spans the space and forms a basis. However, we would then have a basis with more than $n$ vectors. That can't be, as any basis  of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ has to have $n$ vectors. So the assumption that the vectors don't span of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is false and they do span the space. Similar, if there were $n+1$ vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ must be linearly dependent. If they were linearly independent they could form a basis with more than $n$ elements. Again this can be true, hence they are linearly dependent. ◻

## Subspaces

Suppose that $W$ is a nonempty subset of the vector space $V$, which
also satisfies all the vector space axioms itself, then $W$ is called a
subspace of $V$. It is important to realise that for $W$ to be subspace
of $V$, then $W$ must satisfy the following conditions:

::: {.Definition #subspace}
## Subspace 
A subset $W \subseteq V$ of vectors in a vector
space $V$ is called a subspace of $V$ if the following conditions hold:

\(i\) ${\vec 0}\in W,$

\(ii\) if ${\vec u} \in W$ and ${\vec v} \in W$ then ${\vec u}+{\vec 
v\in }W$ ;

\(iii\) if ${\vec u\in }W$ then $a{\vec u\in }W$ for all $a\in K$.
:::

All other axioms are automatically satisfied because each element in $W$
is already in $V$.

::: {#exm-    }
For any vector space $V$, $V$ is always a subspace of
itself.
:::

::: {#exm-    }
We also always have a subspace $\{\vec{0}\}$ consisting
of the zero vector alone. This is called the trivial subspace, and its
dimension is $0$, because it has no linearly independent sets of vectors
at all.
:::

::: {#exm-    }
The subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ are $\{\vec{0}\}$,
lines through the origin, and $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ itself.
:::

::: {#exm-    }

$W$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{3}$.
:::

::: {#exm-    }
The set $W=\{(x,y,z,w)^{T}:x+y+z=1\}$ is not a subspace
of $\mathbb{R}^{4}$. The simplest way to see this is that
${\vec 0\not\in }W$. Another way is to choose suitable vectors
$\vec{u},\vec{v}\in W$ then show that $\vec{u}+\vec{v}\not\in W$. A
third way is to choose a suitable ${\vec u} \in 
W$ then show that $a{\vec u\not\in }W$ for any $a\neq 1$. Any one of the
reasons suffices.

for $S$.
:::

::: {.Theorem} 
## Intersection of subspaces
 If $W_{1}$ and $W_{2}$ are subspaces of $V$ then so is $W_{1}\cap W_{2}$.
:::

::: {.Proof}
Let $\vec{u},\vec{v}\in W_{1}\cap W_{2}$ and $a\in K$. Then
$\vec{u}+\vec{v}\in W_{1}$ (because $W_{1}$ is a subspace) and
$\vec{u}+\vec{v}\in W_{2}$ (because $W_{2}$ is a subspace). Hence
$\vec{u}+\vec{v}\in W_{1}\cap W_{2}$. Similarly, we get
$a\vec{v}\in W_{1}\cap W_{2}$ so $W_{1}\cap W_{2}$ is a subspace of
$V$. ◻

($a,b,c$ real) while $W_{2}$ is the subspace of matrices of
the form $\left[ 
\begin{array}{cc}
a & a \\ 
b & b
\end{array}
\right]$. Then $W_{1}\cap W_{2}$ consists of all matrices of the form
$\left[ 
\begin{array}{cc}
0 & 0 \\ 
b & b
\end{array}
\right]$ , which is a subspace of $V$.
:::

::: {.callout-note} 
## Remark
While $W_{1}\cap W_{2}$ is a subpace, $W_{1}\cup W_{2}$ is in general not a
subspace. For exampe if $W_1$ and $W_2$ are the x- and y-axis of $\mathbb{R}^2$, the union is not a subspace.  
:::

::: {#exm-    }
Let $V=\mathbb{R}^{2}$, let
$W=\{(a,0)^{T}:a\in\mathbb{R}\}$ and
$W_{2}=\{(0,b)^{T}:b\in\mathbb{R}\}$. Then $W_{1}$, $W_{2}$ are
subspaces of $V$, but $W_{1}\cup W_{2}$ is not a subspace, because
$(1,0)^{T}\in W_{1}\cup W_{2}$ and $(0,1)^{T}\in W_{1}\cup W_{2}$, but
$(1,0)^{T}+(0,1)^{T}=(1,1)^{T}\notin W_{1}\cup W_{2}$.
:::

::: {#exm-    }
The set $W=\{(x,y,z)^{T}:x^{2}+y^{2}=z\}$ is not a
subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{3}$.

The vectors ${\vec u=}\left( 0,1,1\right) ^{T}$ and ${\vec v}=\left(
1,2,5\right) ^{T}$ are both in $W$ but ${\vec u}+{\vec v}$ is not.
:::

The three conditions in the definition of a subspace state that every
linear combination of vectors of the subspace has to be an element of
the subspace. This proves the following theorem:

::: {.Lemma}
## Span is a subspace
${\rm span}({\vec v}_{1},{\vec v}_{2},...,{\vec v}_{n})$ is a subspace of
$V$ for ${\vec v}_{1},{\vec v}_{2},...,{\vec v}_{n} \in V$.
:::

::: {.Proof}
$W={\rm span}({\vec v}_{1},{\vec v}_{2},...,{\vec v}_{n})$ is
by definition a subset of $V$. The $\vec{0}$ is in $W$, which is
property (i) in the definition of a subspace, and (ii) and (iii) are
also satisfied due to the span including all linear combinations. ◻
:::

::: {#exm-    }
The set $W=\{(x,y,z,w)^{T}:x+y+z=w\}$ is a subspace of
$\mathbb{R}^{4}$. We can show this in two ways: (a) by using the
definition of a subspace (\ref{subspace}) or (b) by finding a spanning set and using the
above theorem. Method (a) requires checking the three conditions for a
subspace:

1.  ${\bf 0} = (0,0,0,0)^{T} \in W$ for $x=y=z=0$.

2.  With ${\bf u} =  (x,y,z,x+y+z)^{T} \in W$ and
    ${\bf v} = (x',y',z',x'+y'+z')^{T} \in W$ also
    ${\bf u} + {\bf v}=  (x+x',y+y',z+z',(x+x')+(y+y')+(z+z'))^{T} \in W$

3.  With ${\bf u} =  (x,y,z,x+y+z)^{T} \in W$ and $\lambda {\bf u} =  (\lambda x,\lambda y,\lambda z, \lambda (x+y+z))^{T} \in W$

For method (b), we have to find vectors which span $W$. Note that the
set $W$ has three free parameters, which can be used to represent an
arbitrary element of $W$:
$$\scriptscriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   x\\y\\z\\x+y+z  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle = x \scriptscriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   1\\0\\0\\1  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle +y \scriptscriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   0\\1\\0\\1  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle + z \scriptscriptstyle \begin{pmatrix}   0\\0\\1\\1  \end{pmatrix} \textstyle$$
Hence $W = {\rm span}((1,0,0,1)^{T}, (0,1,0,1)^{T}, (0,0,1,1)^{T})$.
This second approach has the advantage that the spanning set can also be
used to find a basis for the subspace. Indeed, the three vectors are
also linearly independent (prove!), and we obtain the basis
${\vec v}_{1}=(1,0,0,1)^{T},{\vec v}_{2}=(0,1,0,1)^{T},{\vec v}
_{3}=(0,0,1,1)^{T}$.

## Scalar- and Inner  Product

::: {.Definition #scalarproduct}
## scalar product, Euclidean product, inner product, dot product

For any two vectors $\vec{v}$, $\vec{w} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ with components

we define the inner or scalar product as 
$$ \vec{v} \cdot \vec{w} = v_{1}w_{1}+ v_{2}w_{2}+..+v_{n}w_{n}  \in \mathbb{R}. $$
:::

Usually we use as a symbol for the scalar product the dot. Sometimes the notation $\langle \vec{v},\vec{w}\rangle$ is used as well.

::: {.Corollary #scalarproduct}
If $\vec{u}$, $\vec{v}$, $\vec{w}$ are vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and $\alpha$ is scalar, then

a)  $$\vec{u}\cdot\vec{v}=\vec{v}\cdot\vec{u}$$

b)  $$\vec{u}\cdot(\vec{v}+\vec{w})=\vec{u}\cdot\vec{v}+\vec{u}\cdot\vec{w}$$

c)  $$\alpha(\vec{u}\cdot\vec{v})=\alpha\vec{u}\cdot\vec{v}=\vec{u}\cdot(\alpha\vec{v})$$
:::

(a)

$$\begin{aligned}

\end{aligned}$$

(b)

$$\begin{aligned}
\vec{u}\cdot(\vec{v}+\vec{w}) & = u_{1}(v_{1}+w_{1})+\cdots+u_{n}(v_{n}+w_{n})\\
& =  (u_{1}v_{1}+\cdots+u_{n}v_{n})+(u_{1}w_{1}+\cdots+u_{n}w_{n})\\

$$\begin{aligned}
\alpha(\vec{u}\cdot\vec{v}) & = \alpha(u_{1}v_{1}+u_{2}v_{2}+\cdots+u_{n}v_{n})\\

We also have

$$\begin{aligned}

We note that if we use for both entries of the scalar product the same vector then we get

The norm (or length) of a vector $\vec{v} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is defined as 
$$\|\vec{v}\|=\sqrt{\vec{v}\cdot \vec{v}} = \sqrt{v_{1}^{2}+ v_{2}^{2} +...+v_{n}^{2}} \ge 0 $$
::: 

Note that this definition matches with the length of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ as calculated by the Pythagorean theorem. 


::: {.Corollary}
The scalar product is related to the angle between the vectors by
$$ \vec{v} \cdot \vec{w}  = \|\vec{v} \| \ \|\vec{w}\| \cos{\alpha} .$$
:::

::: {.Proof}
Let $\vec{v}$, $\vec{w}$ be non-zero vectors. Then three vectors $\vec{v}$, $\vec{w}$ and $\vec{v}-\vec{w}$ give three sides of a triangle, see figure \ref{fig:pyth}. 
Therefore by the Pythagorean theorem we have
$$\begin{aligned}
\|\vec{v}-\vec{w}\|^{2} & =  a^2+b^2 = ((\|\vec{v}\|-\|\vec{w}\|\cos\alpha)^{2}+ (\|\vec{w}\| \sin\alpha)^{2}) \\

On the other hand the definition of a length gives us 
$$\begin{aligned}
\|\vec{v}-\vec{w}\|^{2} & =  (\vec{v}-\vec{w})\cdot  (\vec{v}-\vec{w}) \\
& = \vec{v}\cdot \vec{v} - 2 \vec{w}\cdot \vec{v} +  \vec{w}\cdot \vec{w} 
\end{aligned} $$
Comparing the two results we find  $\vec{v}\cdot\vec{w}=\|\vec{v}\|\|\vec{w}\|\cos\alpha$.
:::

An immediate consequence is that for two non-vanishing vectors ($\|\vec{v}\|, \|\vec{w}\| \neq 0$) we have
$$ \vec{v} \cdot \vec{w}  = 0 \Leftrightarrow  \vec{v} \perp \vec{w},  $$ 
i.e.~the scalar product vanishes if and only if they are perpendicular to each other.


::: {.Corollary  #projec}
If $\vec{n}$ is a unit vector, i.e.~$\| \vec{n} \| =1$, then $\vec{n}\cdot\vec{v}$ is the length of the projection of $\vec{v}$ onto the direction of $\vec{n}$. If the angle between $\vec{n}$ and $\vec{v}$ is greater than $\pi/2$ it is minus the length of the projection.

::: {.Proof}
$$ \vec{n}\cdot\vec{v}= \underbrace{ \|\vec{n} \|}_{=1} \ \|\vec{v}\| \cos{\alpha} = \ \|\vec{v}\| \cos{\alpha}  $$

The distance between two points $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ is in general  given by the norm of $\vec{u}-\vec{v}$:  
$$\| \vec{u}-\vec{v}\| = \| \vec{v}-\vec{u} \|.$$ This is a meaningful definition since it is the shortest distance between the points with the position vectors $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{u}$ is the length of the vector between the two points. This is stated by the triangle inequality:

::: {.Corollary}
For any two vectors $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$ (of a normed vector space)  we have the triangle inequality:
$$\| \vec{x} +\vec{y}\| \le  \|\vec{x}\| + \| \vec{y} \| .$$
:::

::: {.Proof}
$$\begin{aligned}
\| \vec{x} +\vec{y}\|^{2} & =  (\vec{x}+\vec{y})\cdot(\vec{x}+\vec{y})\\
& = \vec{x}\cdot \vec{x}+\vec{y} \cdot \vec{y} + 2 \vec{x}\cdot \vec{y} \\
  & =    \| \vec{x} \|^{2} + \| \vec{y}\|^{2} + 2 \|\vec{x} \| \| \vec{y}\| \cos(\alpha)  \\
  & \le   \| \vec{x} \|^2 + \| \vec{y}\|^2 + 2 \|\vec{x} \| \| \vec{y}\| \\
  & =  ( \| \vec{x} \| + \| \vec{y}\|)^{2}  \\
  \Rightarrow  \| \vec{x} +\vec{y}\| &\le  \| \vec{x} \| + \| \vec{y}\|

One can use the key properties of the Scalar Product (\ref{scalarproduct}) as a basis to define a generalisation of a scalar product, called innner product.  

::: {.Definition}
## Inner Product

The Inner product between two vectors in the vector space $V$ over the field $\mathbb{C}$ (or $\mathbb{R}$) is a
map 
$$\begin{aligned}
\langle·, ·\rangle   : \quad & V \times V \rightarrow \mathbb{C} \\
&  (\vec{u}, \vec{v}) \rightarrow  \langle \vec{u}, \vec{v}\rangle   
\end{aligned}$$
that satisfies the following requirements  $\forall \vec{u}, \vec{v}, \vec{w} \in V$ and $a, b \in \mathbb{C}$:

(1) $\langle \vec{u}, \vec{v} \rangle = \overline{\langle \vec{v}, \vec{u}\rangle}$ \quad (symmetric up to complex conjugation)

(2) $\langle a \vec{u} + b \vec{v}, \vec{w} \rangle = a \langle \vec{u}, \vec{w}\rangle   + b \langle \vec{v}, \vec{w}\rangle$  \quad (linearity)

(3) $\langle \vec{v}, \vec{v} \rangle \ge 0$. $\langle \vec{v}, \vec{v} \rangle = 0$ if and only if $\vec{v} = 0$. \quad (positive definiteness)
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Remark
The third property implies that the inner prodoct of a vector with itself is real and non-negative. This allows us to define the norm of a vector in the same way as before 
$$\|\vec{v}\| = \sqrt{\langle\vec{v},\vec{v} \rangle}$$ and the norm becomes a real non-negative number.

 The space of polynomials of degree $n$, $P_n(t)$, defined on
the interval $[-1, 1] \subset \mathbb{R}$ can be given an inner product 

$$\begin{aligned} 
 \langle ·, · \rangle: \quad & P_n (t) \times P_n (t) \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \\
& (p (t) , q (t)) \longrightarrow  \langle p, q \rangle = \int_{-1}^1 p (t) q (t)\,dt.
