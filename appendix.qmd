## Carl Friedrich Gauss 

Carl Friedrich Gauss (Gau√ü) (30 April
1777 - 23 February 1855) was a German mathematician and scientist of
profound genius who contributed significantly to many fields, including
number theory, analysis, differential geometry, geodesy, magnetism,
astronomy and optics. Sometimes known as \"the prince of
mathematicians\" and \"greatest mathematician since antiquity\", Gauss
had a remarkable influence in many fields of mathematics and science and
is ranked as one of history's most influential mathematicians.

Gauss was a child prodigy, of whom there are many anecdotes pertaining
to his astounding precocity while a mere toddler, and made his first
ground-breaking mathematical discoveries while still a teenager. He
completed Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, his magnum opus, at the age of
twenty-one (1798), though it would not be published until 1801. This
work was fundamental in consolidating number theory as a discipline and
has shaped the field to the present day. [^2]
